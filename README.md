# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures, sorting algorithms, and search algorithms in Java programming language. All data structures have been implemented in a generic type to provide flexibility and reusability.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are included in this repository:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Sorted Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree

Each data structure contains test cases.

## Search Algorithms

The following search algorithms are included in this repository:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search

Each search algorithm contains test cases.

## Sort Algorithms

The following sort algorithms are included in this repository:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

Each sorting algorithm contains test cases.

## Getting Started
